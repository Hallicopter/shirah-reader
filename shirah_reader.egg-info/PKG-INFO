        ### What is an RSVP reader?
        RSVP stands for [Rapid Serial Visual presentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation).
        Its a controversial method to enable speedreading. I have been using this on my devices, and it has given me great results. I wanted to have an option to do this in the terminal too.
        Ignore the haters, and try it for yourself.
        Also, I don't like that the best options on a computer are paid softwares.
